# 📈 Sales Prediction Using Python 📊

## Oasis Infobyte Internship - July P2 Batch

### Data Science Intern: Rupa Navale 👩‍💻

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project aimed at predicting future sales based on advertising expenses and related factors. The project involves developing a machine learning model using Python, particularly utilizing the scikit-learn library.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales based on advertising expenditures in different channels. By doing so, the project aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making for optimizing marketing strategies.

## 📚 Project Structure

The project is structured into several key steps, including:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Importing the necessary Python libraries, such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

2. **Loading and Exploring the Dataset**: Loading the dataset containing information about advertising expenses and sales, and performing exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and content.

3. **Data Preparation**: Splitting the data into features (advertising channels) and the target variable (sales), and preparing them for training and testing.

4. **Splitting Data**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

5. **Training the Model**: Training a linear regression model using the training data to predict sales based on advertising expenses.

6. **Making Predictions**: Using the trained model to make predictions on the test data.

7. **Evaluating Model Performance**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.

8. **Summary**: Summarizing the findings and insights gained from the model, including the impact of different advertising channels on sales.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/rupanavale/OIBSIP-Task-1`

2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the project code and run the cells or the script to execute the project steps.

4. Explore the model's predictions, metrics, and visualizations to understand the relationship between advertising expenses and sales.

## 📊 Results and Insights

The model's performance metrics indicate a strong correlation between advertising expenses and sales, with a high R-squared value suggesting a good fit. Among the advertising channels, 'TV' and 'Radio' have positive coefficients, indicating a significant impact on sales, while 'Newspaper' has a minor negative effect.

The findings suggest that companies should focus more on 'TV' and 'Radio' advertising to maximize their impact on sales. 'Newspaper' advertising, while having a small negative impact, might benefit from alternative strategies to improve its effectiveness.

## 🎉 Conclusion

This project showcases how data science and machine learning techniques can be applied to predict sales based on advertising expenditures. By utilizing Python and scikit-learn, a predictive model was developed to assist in data-driven decision-making for optimizing marketing strategies.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository to gain insights into the model's development, evaluation, and findings.
